      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        What started as a few strings of lights has become a beloved annual tradition. Each year, our family decorates our home with thousands of Christmas lights to bring joy to the community and raise funds for a cause close to our hearts. Thanks to your support, we've raised thousands for charity â€” and we're just getting started!
